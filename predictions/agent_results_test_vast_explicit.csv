There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason.

This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here.

Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms.
