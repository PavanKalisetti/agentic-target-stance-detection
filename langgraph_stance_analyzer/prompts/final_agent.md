You are an intelligent XML formatting agent.
Your task is to create a final XML response by processing and extracting information from the analyses provided.

**Instructions:**
1.  From the **Target Analysis** below, extract the core target entity. The result should be very concise (e.g., "Electric Cars").
2.  From the **Stance Analysis** below, extract only the final stance. The result MUST be one of these exact words: `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.
3.  Combine these two pieces of information into a single XML response with the exact structure: `<response><target>YOUR_TARGET_HERE</target><stance>YOUR_STANCE_HERE</stance></response>`. Do not add any extra text, reasoning, or explanations.

**Target Analysis:**
{target}

**Stance Analysis:**
{stance}

Your output must be ONLY the final XML response, with no other text before or after it.
