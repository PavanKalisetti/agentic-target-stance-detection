Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large bonuses to those that risked everyone else's money and lost. We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments. It would also be a big help if we implement a method to lower income inequality so that unsustainable amounts of personal debt are required to prop up our economy. Remember when Chairman Greenspan testified on TV in a Senate hearing and urged existing homeowners to tap into their equity? The rapid rise in personal debt in the form of credit card debt, mortgages and student loans is feeding these to-big-to fail financial behemoths that throw their weight around Washington.",bail out,AGAINST,debt,AGAINST,0.5022499999999999,True
"As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should have a better shot at them. This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law. This is our present policy, which we wind up with because it is supposedly cheaper in the short run. People unlikely to make trouble because they cannot find jobs are left to their own devices.",an employer 's first impression,AGAINST,criminal background,FAVOR,0.73775,False

"This used to anger me, now it doesn't. The drugs are here to stay.

They don't spend 7 hours in the gym everyday to look like that..They spend about an hour per day, take a boatload of pills, powders and/or some injections, and eat a pretty good diet with low carbs and lots of protein. I can lift as much as a lot of them, but I'm a bald old guy who doesn't inject anything and I look like it. Who the heck wants to look like me? We need to just let it go.

"I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income.

Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates.
