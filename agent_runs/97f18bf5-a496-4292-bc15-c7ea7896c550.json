The writer has to know this is a negative sum game, not even a zero sum game. For every dollar the city takes in, you can be sure the casino operators take at least five. The people who spend this money are overwhelmingly those who can't afford it, so that the 11 million they get back in services is less than what they lost in the first place. At the end of the day, the casino ends up making no new product, or service, other than escapist entertainment. But, but, but, you say, the casino puts the money back in the community. I bet. See the piece by Professor Simon on Atlantic City. Maybe the money does come out of thin air -- Canadians and non-Detroiters. Well that's great. Here you go, Paul. Sorry, Peter.",

        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis**\n\nThe text exhibits a negative tone, with a critical sentiment towards casino taxes and development revenue. The author's tone is condescending, ironic, and dismissive, as evident from the use of rhetorical questions (\"And where does this revenue come from? Thin air?\") and sarcastic phrases (\"But, but, but...\").\n\nKey linguistic features include:\n\n1. **Critique of economic logic**: The author challenges the idea that casino taxes are a net gain for the city, pointing out the disproportionate amount taken by casino operators.\n2. **Use of metaphors**: \"Thin air\" is used to emphasize the idea that revenue comes from unsustainable or unnatural sources.\n3. **Rhetorical devices**: The author employs rhetorical questions (\"And where does this revenue come from?\"), sarcasm (\"But, but, but...\"), and irony (\"Maybe the money does come out of thin air -- Canadians and non-Detroiters\") to convey their skepticism.\n4. **Informal tone**: The use of colloquial expressions (\"Here you go, Paul. Sorry, Peter.\") creates a sense of familiarity and informality, which contrasts with the formal tone typically associated with economic or policy discussions.\n5. **Reference to external sources**: The mention of Professor Simon's piece on Atlantic City serves as an appeal to authority, lending credibility to the author's argument.\n\nOverall, the text reveals a critical perspective on casino taxes and development revenue, using linguistic devices to convey a negative sentiment and challenge the conventional wisdom on this topic.",
