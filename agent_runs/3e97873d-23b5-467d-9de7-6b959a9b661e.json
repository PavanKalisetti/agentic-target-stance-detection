        "linguistic_analysis": "Here's a concise summary of the linguistic features in the given text:\n\n**Sentiment:**\nThe overall sentiment of the text is neutral with a hint of criticism towards Facebook. The author presents both sides of the argument, acknowledging that Facebook didn't cause the cheating, but also expressing concern about its role in facilitating it.\n\n**Tone:**\nThe tone is analytical and slightly provocative, with a touch of sarcasm (\"call me crazy\"). The author uses rhetorical questions to encourage critical thinking and invite the reader to consider alternative perspectives.\n\n**Style:**\n\n1. **Argumentative structure:** The text employs an argumentative structure, presenting a thesis statement (Facebook shares some responsibility) and supporting it with logical reasoning.\n2. **Metaphorical language:** The comparison between Facebook and gun dealers/drug dealers is a clever metaphor that highlights the author's concern about accessibility and responsibility.\n3. **Hypothetical framing:** The phrase \"call me crazy\" serves as a rhetorical device to frame the author's opinion as a reasonable, albeit unconventional, perspective.\n4. **Tone marking:** The use of phrases like \"it's not to suggest that Facebook is entirely at fault\" creates a tone of nuance and moderation.\n\n**Other notable features:**\n\n1. **Passive voice:** The text uses passive voice in the phrase \"Facebook gets a bad rap,\" which subtly shifts attention from the company itself to its perceived reputation.\n2. **Modal verbs:** The use of modal verbs like \"made it more convenient\" and \"play an active role\" implies a sense of obligation or responsibility, highlighting the author's critical stance.\n\nOverall, the linguistic features in this text reveal a thoughtful, analytical, and slightly provocative approach to discussing Facebook's role in facilitating cheating.",
