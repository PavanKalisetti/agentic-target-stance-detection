Don't try to \"divide and conquer,\" to separate the might-be diabetics from the active outdoorspeople from the folks who cross the streets used by cars. In short, you have no idea which camp you fall into until your appendix bursts or you have a stroke from a congenital aneurism no one could tell you had or you get mugged and knifed on vacation in a strange city. \"They could choose innovative plans that provide the coordinated care, information technologies, effectiveness research and safer medicine Medicare has promised but failed to deliver.\" Who DOESN'T deserve to get these plans? Why can't this be the baseline of our national healthcare system? What alternative would YOU choose that didn't meet these guidelines? C'mon, get real. Is this proposal the dictionary definition of what people call \"straw man\" arguments?",

        "target": "The implicit target in this text is Republican politicians and their health care proposals.\n\nThe explicit criticism targets the needs of politicians and lobbyists, implying that they are prioritized over those of enrollees. The use of phrases such as \"divide and conquer,\" \"might-be diabetics from the active outdoorspeople,\" suggests a critique of divisive or targeted approaches to healthcare, which is a common criticism of Republican health care proposals in the United States. Additionally, the mention of innovative plans that provide coordinated care and safety measures, but also failed to deliver on by Medicare (a government-run program), implies a comparison between Democratic and Republican ideologies.",

        "stance": "Negative\n\nThe text expresses criticism towards the implicit target, Republican politicians and their health care proposals, highlighting concerns about prioritizing enrollees' needs over those of politicians and lobbyists. The use of phrases such as \"divide and conquer\" and \"straw man\" arguments suggests a negative stance towards these proposals. Additionally, the comparison with Medicare's failed delivery of innovative plans implies that Republican ideologies are inadequate or ineffective in addressing healthcare needs.
