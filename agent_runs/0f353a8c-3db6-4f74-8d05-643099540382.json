        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis**\n\nThe given text exhibits several key linguistic features:\n\n1. **Sentiment**: The tone is critical and confrontational, with a hint of accusation. The author expresses skepticism towards the CDC's vaccination schedule.\n2. **Tone markers**: The use of phrases like \"You don't come close to explaining\" and \"It seems not\" creates a sense of incredulity and dismissal.\n3. **Rhetorical questions**: The final question (\"Do you have actual evidence...\") serves as a challenge, implying that the opponent has failed to provide sufficient justification for their stance.\n4. **Emphasis on skepticism**: The repetition of \"it seems not\" emphasizes the author's doubt regarding the CDC's recommended schedule and implies that the opposing viewpoint is unsubstantiated.\n5. **Language of criticism**: Words like \"reasonable\" are used in a way that suggests disagreement, implying that the author believes the parent's decision to deviate from the CDC's schedule is unjustified.\n\nOverall, the text displays a confrontational tone, with the author using rhetorical questions and emotive language to challenge the opposing viewpoint.",
