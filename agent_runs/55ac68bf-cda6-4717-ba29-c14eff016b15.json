        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis Summary**\n\nThe text exhibits a tone of **argumentative reasoning**, as the author presents a logical argument against tipping, questioning its exclusivity for food delivery services. The language used is characterized by:\n\n1. **Socratic irony**: The author uses rhetorical questions (\"Tip the doctor...\") to challenge the conventional wisdom and highlight the absurdity of exclusive tipping practices.\n2. **Anaphora**: Repetition of \"Tip\" in the initial sentences creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the author's point about the arbitrariness of tipping for food delivery services.\n3. **Rhetorical emphasis**: Phrases like \"the best way to ensure optimal service\" and \"one-price to the customer\" are used to drive home the argument, rather than for their literal meaning.\n4. **Critique by analogy**: The author uses analogies (e.g., tipping a doctor) to demonstrate that tipping is not a specialized practice but rather a convenient one-size-fits-all solution.\n5. **Emphasis on practicality and efficiency**: The author highlights the extra calculation required with tipping, implying that it's an unnecessary complication.\n6. **Tone of indignation**: Phrases like \"I fail to see\" convey a sense of frustration and disappointment at what the author perceives as a flawed system.\n\nOverall, the text demonstrates a sophisticated use of language to support a nuanced argument against tipping in food delivery services.",

        "stance": "Negative.\n\nThe author's tone is critical towards tipping, particularly in the context of the restaurant industry, and presents a counterargument for a one-price system. They imply that tipping can be burdensome to customers and does not provide a fair compensation structure for employees. This negative opinion towards tipping specifically in the restaurant industry, as opposed to other industries where the author believes a one-price system is sufficient, indicates a generally negative stance towards the target's views on tipping.",
