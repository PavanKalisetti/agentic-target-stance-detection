The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!",

This blend creates a sense of approachability while maintaining authority.\n3. **Style:**\n\t* **Argumentative structure**: The text presents a clear argument in favor of research papers, addressing potential counterarguments (e.g., \"The internet may give students...\").\n\t* **Rhetorical devices:** Phrases like \"Absolutely not!\" and \"Let's not ask for the moon!\" are used to create emphasis and convey a sense of conviction.\n\t* **Transitions**: The speaker uses transitional phrases (\"Now more than ever,\" \"This might not be the most exciting assignment...\") to connect ideas and maintain flow.\n4. **Linguistic nuances:**\n\t* **Hedges** (e.g., \"some way\", \"I suppose\"): Used to convey uncertainty or reserve, adding a touch of nuance to the text.\n\t* **Modal verbs**: The speaker employs modal verbs like \"ought\" to express obligation and responsibility.\n5. **Informal language:** The presence of colloquial expressions (\"Absolutely not!\", \"Let's not ask for the moon!\") contributes to an informal tone, making the text more approachable and conversational.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe linguistic features in this text reveal a speaker who is passionate about promoting critical thinking skills through research papers. By balancing informality with formality, the speaker creates a sense of engagement while maintaining authority on the topic.",
