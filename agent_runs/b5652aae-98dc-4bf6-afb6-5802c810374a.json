It has been shown that people with a college degree on average have significantly increased earnings over their life time; and further that the increased taxes collected on those earnings off sets the cost of their education several fold. The economic argument fails. College is a good public investment.",

The author's stance is assertive, but not aggressive.\n* **Style:** The text employs an analytical and argumentative style, characteristic of academic writing. The use of transitional phrases (\"First,\" \"The argument ignores\") and sentence structures (e.g., \"It has been shown...\") creates a sense of logical progression and credibility.\n* **Language features:**\n\t+ **Rhetorical devices:** The author uses rhetorical questions (\"What about the students who become taxpayers?\"), which implies that the opposing viewpoint is incomplete or flawed.\n\t+ **Economical language:** Technical terms like \"offsets\" and \"good public investment\" convey a sense of expertise and add weight to the argument.\n\t+ **Contrastive structure:** The author employs a contrastive structure, comparing the costs of free college education (shifted from students to taxpayers) to its benefits (increased earnings and offsetting taxes).\n* **Tone markers:**\n\t+ **Implication of opposition ignorance**: Phrases like \"The argument ignores\" imply that the opposing viewpoint is uninformed or neglectful.\n\t+ **Certainty language:** Statements like \"It has been shown\" create a sense of certitude, emphasizing the author's expertise and confidence in their argument.\n\nOverall, the text presents a well-reasoned and articulate argument, with a focus on economic analysis.
