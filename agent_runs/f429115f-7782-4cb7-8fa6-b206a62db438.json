The author questions the assumption made by others (\"Really?\"), implying that they find it implausible.\n* **Tone**: The tone is critical and outraged, with a sense of moral indignation. The use of rhetorical questions (\"But this isn't a problem?\") emphasizes the author's incredulity and frustration.\n* **Style**: The style is argumentative and confrontational, with a focus on presenting counterexamples to challenge assumptions made by others. The use of direct questions and exclamations (\"Really?\", \"But this isn't a problem?\") creates a sense of urgency and emphasis.\n* **Rhetorical devices**: The author employs rhetorical questions, which are used to elicit a response from the reader or to emphasize a point. They also use juxtaposition (\"111 killed in US vs. 52 killed by police in UK for entire 20th century\"), which highlights the disparity between the two statistics and emphasizes the severity of the issue.\n* **Emphasis**: The author uses emphatic language (\"Really?\", \"But this isn't a problem?\") to emphasize their point and create a sense of shock or outrage. This emphasis also serves to challenge the assumption made by others and to prompt the reader to reevaluate their perspective.\n* **Tone markers**: Words like \"But\" and \"Really?\" serve as tone markers, indicating the author's skepticism and incredulity.\n\nOverall, the linguistic features of this text suggest a critical and confrontational approach to discussing issues related to police violence and use of force.",
