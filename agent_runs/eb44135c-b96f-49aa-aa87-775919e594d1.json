        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis Summary**\n\nThe given text exhibits several notable linguistic features:\n\n* **Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is one of concern or alarm, as indicated by the use of \"bad\" to describe the effect of environmental changes on Earth.\n* **Tone:** The tone is straightforward and matter-of-fact, lacking any emotional or persuasive language. It presents a factual statement rather than an opinion or argument.\n* **Style:**\n\t+ **Formal/informal**: The text falls into a formal style due to the simplicity of its vocabulary and grammatical structure.\n\t+ **Neutral/objective**: The language used is objective, providing a neutral account of environmental changes without taking a stance or expressing a personal opinion.\n\t+ **Concise**: The text uses short sentences and basic sentence structures, conveying the message efficiently.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n\n* The use of \"bad\" as an adjective implies a negative value judgment about environmental change, which might be interpreted as slightly emotive.\n* The lack of descriptive language or specific examples to support the claim makes it somewhat generic and lacks persuasive force.",
