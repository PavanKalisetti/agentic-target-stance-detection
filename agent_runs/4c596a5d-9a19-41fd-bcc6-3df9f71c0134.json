Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad.

        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis**\n\nThe given text exhibits several key linguistic features:\n\n* **Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is neutral-to-critical, with a hint of skepticism and advocacy for cost-effective public education.\n* **Tone:** The tone is informative, analytical, and slightly argumentative, as the author presents counterarguments to the idea of \"free college\" and advocates for a more efficient system.\n* **Style:** The style is straightforward, direct, and conversational, with a touch of informality. The use of rhetorical questions (\"Yes it does...\") and colloquial expressions (\"just a simple fact\") creates a sense of friendliness and approachability.\n* **Argumentation structure:** The text employs an antithetical argumentative structure, where the author presents opposing views to challenge the notion of \"free college\" and proposes an alternative vision for public education.\n* **Rhetorical devices:**\n\t+ Repetition (e.g., \"it does not change.../Yes it does...\") emphasizes the point being made.\n\t+ Metaphor (\"spends per student\") helps to simplify complex financial concepts.\n\t+ Allusion (to the current system as the \"worst of all worlds\") creates a sense of urgency and highlights the perceived flaws in existing policies.\n* **Language usage:**\n\t+ Technical vocabulary (e.g., \"tuition cap\", \"public subsidies\") is used to convey specialized knowledge and authority on the subject matter.\n\t+ Informal language (e.g., \"a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student...\") makes the text more accessible and engaging.\n\nOverall, the linguistic features of this text contribute to a nuanced, analytical discussion of the complex issues surrounding higher education costs.",
