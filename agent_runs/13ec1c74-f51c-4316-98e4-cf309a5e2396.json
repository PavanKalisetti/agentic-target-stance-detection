    "input_text": "\"Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?\" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?",

        "linguistic_analysis": "**Linguistic Analysis:**\n\nThe given text exhibits several key linguistic features:\n\n1. **Critical tone**: The author expresses skepticism and criticism towards the notion that immigrants take jobs from American-born workers, using phrases like \"re-treading the same arguments\" and \"frothed about.\"\n2. **Rhetorical questions**: The author asks rhetorical questions (\"Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?\") to highlight the flaws in the original argument.\n3. **Historical allusions**: The comparison of modern nativists with 19th-century Know-Nothings serves as a literary device to emphasize the cyclical nature of xenophobic attitudes.\n4. **Analytical style**: The author employs analytical reasoning to challenge the assumption that immigration is the primary cause of job market decline, instead pointing out other possible factors like outsourcing and socio-economic issues.\n5. **Polite rebuke**: The tone remains polite, yet firm, throughout the text, using phrases like \"an interesting perspective\" and \"maybe we should look instead\" to convey a sense of constructive criticism.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis:**\n\n* Overall sentiment is neutral-critical, with a leaning towards skepticism and analytical reasoning.\n* Tone is predominantly negative towards nativist attitudes, but maintains a respectful tone when addressing opposing viewpoints.\n\n**Style Analysis:**\n\n* The text employs an analytical style, using logic and historical context to challenge assumptions.\n* The author uses rhetorical questions and literary devices (historical allusions) to engage the reader and make a persuasive argument.",

It critiques nativist arguments while also pointing out potential structural issues such as automation, outsourcing, and changes in education and social mobility that may be contributing to employment challenges. The tone is informative and argumentative but does not express a clear bias or strong emotion towards any particular side of the issue.",
